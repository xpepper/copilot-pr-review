# Delivery roadmap

[SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) is authoritative. The continuation request authorizes the
first implementation increment; the scope's earlier authorization statement is
historical. Items below target roughly 1-3 hours each, not review runtime limits.
An item is complete only with repository evidence. Later items may be split
further when their implementation context is known, without changing scope.
The standing checkpoint-commit and fresh-session handoff workflow is recorded
in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the replaceable next-session prompt lives in
[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

## Completed increment: F1

Implementation: `plugin.json`, `extensions/pr-review/extension.mjs`, and
installation/invocation instructions in `README.md`. A reproducible, no-model
runtime probe is in `scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs`.

The extension candidate uses `joinSession({ commands })` and `session.log()`.
No factory, reviewer, model configuration, PR fetching, GitHub write, or project
safeguard execution is included in F1. No upstream source was reused.

### Demonstrated outcome

On 2026-09-06, using Copilot CLI 1.0.83, its bundled SDK, Node.js 26.1.0, and
macOS arm64:

- Absolute-path local installation succeeded. `copilot plugin list` reported
  `copilot-pr-review (v0.0.1)`, enabled. The installed copy remains available.
- The CLI runtime discovered and launched
  `plugin:copilot-pr-review:pr-review` from its installed plugin cache with
  status `running`, not a project extension or mock SDK.
- `scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs` dispatched the empty/default argument, `status`,
  whitespace-padded `status`, `help`, and `--help`, asserting actual timeline
  output. PR/review flags and extra arguments returned explicit command errors.
- The same probe asserted that the session contained no model turns, subagents,
  or tool executions. The extension performs no target reads or writes and
  declares no model/tool workflow. Runtime cleanup returned no errors.
- A real interactive CLI in a sized pseudo-terminal displayed the expected
  status, help, and unsupported-argument error after typing the slash commands.
  `/exit` then exited successfully. This does not establish cancellation of
  active reviewers, which remains F3.

These observations demonstrate plugin loading, SDK access, slash-command
registration/dispatch, and visible output only. They do not choose the eventual
reviewer execution integration.

### Reproduction

From the repository root:

```sh
copilot --version
copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"
copilot plugin list
COPILOT_CLI_PATH="$(command -v copilot)" \
COPILOT_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk" \
node scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs
copilot --experimental
```

Adjust the SDK path to the installed version; do not install a different SDK as
a silent substitute. In the interactive session, wait for extension loading,
then enter `/pr-review`, `/pr-review help`, and `/pr-review --comment`.
Expect status, usage, and an explicit unsupported-arguments error respectively,
not a review. Reinstall before reproducing after code changes.

### Concrete integration caveats

- `copilot plugin install .` failed with "Invalid plugin spec" on this runtime;
  the absolute-path command above succeeded. The runtime also warns that direct
  installs are deprecated in favor of marketplace installs in a future version.
- The native manifest's `extensions` path is the **parent search directory**:
  the demonstrated layout uses `extensions/`, containing
  `pr-review/extension.mjs`.
- An SDK session with `enableConfigDiscovery: false` did not discover the
  installed plugin, even with `requestExtensions: true`. The successful probe
  explicitly enables configuration discovery and extension support, and awaits
  extension reload before dispatch. It makes no `send`/`sendAndWait` calls.
- Reloading extensions in the already-running development session did not pick
  up the newly installed plugin. Use a fresh CLI session for these instructions.
- `copilot -p '/pr-review status'` did **not** exercise the command: it started
  an ambient model turn and produced an unrelated review-status response.
  This failed probe is not capability evidence. Do not use prompt mode as a
  deterministic slash-command dispatcher; use the interactive entry point or
  the SDK smoke script above.

### API sources consulted

Consulted on 2026-09-06:

- [Official plugin creation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-creating):
  local installation, cached copies, and reinstall behavior.
- [Official plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference):
  native `extensions` manifest field (not Open Plugin Spec `$schema` semantics).
- Installed Copilot CLI `1.0.83`, macOS arm64: `copilot --help`,
  `copilot plugin install --help`, and `copilot help environment`.
- Bundled `copilot-sdk/docs/extensions.md`, `docs/agent-author.md`,
  `extension.d.ts`, and `types.d.ts`: injected SDK, extension lifecycle,
  `JoinSessionConfig`, `CommandDefinition`, `CommandContext`, and `session.log`.
- Bundled `copilot-sdk/docs/factories.md`: candidate for F2 only; documented
  agent factories are not evidence of working reviewers.

The installed SDK is under
`~/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk/` on the development host.
No SDK copy or machine-specific import is shipped in the plugin.

### Uncertainties at the F1 checkpoint

Distinct per-reviewer subscription models/reasoning, simultaneous execution,
per-reviewer progress/results, read-only enforcement, reviewer failure
propagation, and cancellation remain unproven and are reserved for F2/F3.
The surrounding interactive Copilot session is not made read-only by this
extension. No cross-client or other-OS compatibility is claimed.
Future CLI/API compatibility, marketplace migration, and source licensing remain
open. L1 blocks upstream source copying, not this original code. No runtime
blocker was known before starting F2; its outcome is recorded below.

## Completed increment: F2

Implementation: the extension's `models` and `fixture` commands,
`extensions/pr-review/fixture.mjs`, and a tiny original
`extensions/pr-review/fixtures/checkout.js`. `scripts/smoke-fixture.mjs`
exercises pure guards, and `scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs --fixture` exercises the
installed plugin with real inference. No upstream source was reused.

### Runtime candidate and demonstrated outcome

On 2026-09-06, on the same CLI 1.0.83 / bundled SDK / Node.js 26.1.0 /
macOS arm64 environment as F1:

- Agent factory registration did not establish usability. Calling
  `session.factory.run` from the installed extension failed with
  **"Agent factories are not available for this session"**, before model
  execution. Runtime inspection located an availability check in the session
  quota projection. No entitlement/feature gate was overridden.
- Instead, the plugin successfully constructed `CopilotClient` using the
  injected SDK and its default bundled runtime resolution. It created two
  separate sessions with explicit model and reasoning settings, local CLI
  authentication, configuration discovery disabled, an empty tool allowlist,
  and permission denial. No provider credentials were requested or supplied.
- The parent and owned sessions' available-model catalogs were validated before
  prompts. Each owned session's `model.getCurrent()` matched its assignment.
  Actual `assistant.usage` events then confirmed these settings:

| Reviewer | Actual model | Actual reasoning | BYOK | Turn start (epoch ms) | Session idle (epoch ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rounding | `claude-sonnet-5` | `low` | false | 1788730143771 | 1788730147939 |
| shipping | `gpt-5.6-terra` | `high` | false | 1788730143771 | 1788730145935 |

The two independent reviewer session IDs were
`58141075-2af4-4c0e-a342-935bb72d4c78` and
`f1bddcde-b37b-45df-9888-6cc0603632e9`. The observed execution intervals
overlapped by **2164 ms**. These are runtime turn/idle timestamps, not estimates
from the coordinator's promise scheduling and not a provider-side timing claim.

- The CLI timeline displayed both assignments before execution, per-reviewer
  starting/completed messages, and both outputs. Shipping identified the
  incorrect free-shipping basis with `[5000], 10` yielding 5000 instead of
  4500 cents. Rounding reported fractional cents, and also duplicated the
  shipping issue. Outputs remain explicitly **unvalidated**; this demonstrates
  review execution, not Q4 evidence validation or deduplication.
- No reviewer tool execution was observed. The runner treats a tool start as
  an error, not permission-enforcement evidence. Normal `client.stop()` cleanup
  returned no errors for the plugin-owned and smoke runtimes.
- Pure guards cover malformed/missing/duplicate keys, non-distinct assignments,
  unavailable/disabled/unconfigured/BYOK/auto models, and unsupported reasoning.
  Runtime command probes reject malformed settings, an unavailable model, and
  an unsupported effort without starting reviewers. The parent model/reasoning
  remains unchanged.
- A final run after expanding the progress-order and parent-setting assertions
  also completed successfully, with **1912 ms** overlap and the same actual
  model/reasoning assignments. Its reviewer sessions were
  `0cdf64d2-3136-4d09-ba90-536cd697db69` and
  `26fc5a2d-e047-4dec-b702-590946d7133c`.

### Reproduction

```sh
copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"
node scripts/smoke-fixture.mjs
COPILOT_CLI_PATH="$(command -v copilot)" \
COPILOT_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk" \
node scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs

COPILOT_CLI_PATH="$(command -v copilot)" \
COPILOT_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk" \
PR_REVIEW_MODEL_1=claude-sonnet-5 PR_REVIEW_EFFORT_1=low \
PR_REVIEW_MODEL_2=gpt-5.6-terra PR_REVIEW_EFFORT_2=high \
node scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs --fixture
```

The final command uses subscription credits. The model names are reproduction
inputs, not hardcoded defaults; use `/pr-review models` in a fresh CLI to inspect
current availability. The equivalent invocation is:

```text
/pr-review fixture model1=claude-sonnet-5 effort1=low model2=gpt-5.6-terra effort2=high
```

### API sources and concrete caveats

Consulted current official [plugin creation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-creating),
[plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference),
and [SDK getting started](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)
documentation, plus the installed SDK's extension/factory guides,
`extension.d.ts`, `factory.d.ts`, `types.d.ts`, `session.d.ts`, and generated
RPC/event definitions before choosing APIs.

- Factories remain unavailable on the observed account/session. Their RPC types
  also describe `reasoningEffort` and `agent` as accepted but not honored;
  factory reasoning/permission behavior was **not** reached or demonstrated.
  The unsuccessful factory implementation was replaced, not shipped as a
  fallback or silently selected alternative.
- Session-scoped `model.list()` exposes raw CAPI
  `capabilities.supports.reasoning_effort` arrays, not the normalized
  `supportedReasoningEfforts` field from `client.listModels()`. The code uses
  the demonstrated session shape, excludes provider-qualified IDs, and refuses
  unsupported values rather than guessing.
- `sendAndWait` defaults to a 60-second wait timeout, so reviewers instead
  subscribe to events before `send` and wait for idle/error without a timer.
  There is no plugin review deadline, fallback, or elapsed-time retry.
- The plugin owns a separate runtime, not factory subagents in the parent.
  Parent log output bridges progress/results. SDK session transcripts may
  persist normally; this is not the P2 session-bound review cache or a plugin
  cross-session archive.
- Explicit error paths preserve incomplete coverage and normal cleanup exists,
  but failure injection, transport loss, manual cancellation, and extension
  shutdown have **not** been demonstrated. There is no cancel command yet.
  In particular, an extension stopping is not proof its owned runtime and
  reviewers stop; F3 must establish this before selecting the integration.
- Empty tools/configuration isolation plus a benign no-tool result do not prove
  adversarial read-only enforcement. The parent assistant remains unrestricted.
  No PR fetching, publication, safeguard execution, or other-client support
  was added. L1 still blocks upstream source reuse only.

## Exact next increment

**F3 only:** Exercise the plugin-owned SDK-session candidate with an original
adversarial fixture and demonstrate enforceable read-only reviewers. Inject
explicit reviewer failures and retain visible incomplete coverage without a
clean-review claim. Add and demonstrate manual cancellation of active work,
including owned-runtime/session cleanup and prevention of abandoned reviewers
on cancellation or extension shutdown. Cover relevant disconnect/error paths
without introducing review timeouts. Record concrete runtime limitations before
selecting the integration. Do not add PR fetching, publication, configuration
persistence, or project safeguard execution. Keep L1 pending unless separately
authorized; no upstream source reuse.
