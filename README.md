# Copilot PR Review

An original Copilot CLI plugin prototype. **It does not review PRs yet.**
[SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) is the authoritative product specification;
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) records delivery status and runtime evidence.

## Install and invoke

From this checkout:

```sh
copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"
copilot plugin list
copilot --experimental
```

Wait for plugin/extension loading to finish, then enter:

```text
/pr-review
/pr-review status
/pr-review help
/pr-review models
```

These commands are implemented in JavaScript by a plugin-shipped extension, not
a model prompt. Status/help make no model calls. `models` queries the session's
available subscription models and reasoning capabilities without inference.
PR numbers and review flags produce an explicit error.

### Two-reviewer fixture experiment (F2)

After checking `/pr-review models`, supply **all four settings**:

```text
/pr-review fixture model1=claude-sonnet-5 effort1=low model2=gpt-5.6-terra effort2=high
```

These are example assignments demonstrated on the development account, not
defaults. Choose two available models and two distinct supported reasoning
levels. Missing, repeated, unknown, disabled, or unsupported settings are
rejected without substitution. No personal configuration is saved yet.

This command uses Copilot credits. It reads only the bundled original
`extensions/pr-review/fixtures/checkout.js`, not your checkout's PR code.
The plugin creates an owned SDK runtime with two independent reviewer sessions,
displays effective assignments before sending prompts, then displays each
reviewer's starting/completed state and output. Runtime model/reasoning usage
must match the assignments or execution is reported as incomplete. A final
`F2 evidence:` JSON line records outputs, session IDs, usage, and turn timestamps
for reproduction. It is **not** the publish-later cache or a validated finding
format.

Both reviewers are awaited without a review timeout. The runtime is stopped in
`finally` on normal completion or a propagated error. Cancellation during active
work, runtime disconnects, and extension shutdown are **not yet demonstrated**;
do not rely on this prototype for real reviews.

Do **not** use `copilot -p '/pr-review status'` as a substitute. On the observed
CLI, prompt mode treated this as a model prompt rather than dispatching the
extension command. The surrounding assistant may then attempt unrelated work.

During development, load the checkout without installing:

```sh
copilot --experimental --plugin-dir .
```

Restart the CLI after editing the extension. For an installed copy, reinstall
with `copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"` before restarting; installed plugins are cached.
Remove the installed plugin with `copilot plugin uninstall copilot-pr-review`.

## Runtime boundary

This prototype uses the SDK bundled with the CLI; no npm install or provider
credentials are needed. Experimental extension APIs may change. The runtime
candidate is Copilot CLI only; this is not a VS Code compatibility claim.
Local installation and interactive command dispatch have been demonstrated on
Copilot CLI 1.0.83, macOS arm64. That version warns that direct local installs
are deprecated for a future release; no marketplace packaging is implemented yet.

Two concurrent reviewers and explicit model/reasoning selection have been
demonstrated through SDK command dispatch. Agent factories were unavailable in
the observed session, so the candidate uses plugin-owned SDK sessions instead.
The SDK resolves its bundled runtime; no machine-specific SDK path is shipped.

Reviewer sessions disable configuration discovery, expose no tools, and deny
permission requests. The happy-path fixture used no tools; this is **not proof
of adversarial read-only enforcement**. Failure supervision and manual
cancellation remain F3, before finalizing the runtime integration. The prototype
does not fetch PRs, publish to GitHub, or execute project safeguards. It does not
restrict or change the model of the surrounding Copilot session. The SDK may
retain its own session transcripts; no plugin review archive is implemented.

No upstream source has been copied. Source reuse/licensing assessment remains
pending before any upstream code is reused.

## Reproduce the runtime smoke exercise

After installing the current checkout, run the no-inference probes using
Node.js 22+ and the SDK bundled with the installed CLI (adjust its path):

```sh
node scripts/smoke-fixture.mjs
COPILOT_CLI_PATH="$(command -v copilot)" \
COPILOT_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk" \
node scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs
```

The first probe exercises argument/capability guards without a runtime. The
runtime probe discovers the **installed** extension, dispatches status/help,
model listing, and invalid settings, and asserts explicit errors without model
turns. It requires authenticated model-list access. It uses configuration
discovery to find plugins, so run it only with trusted installed configuration.
It stops its runtime in `finally`, including on failure.

To exercise actual concurrent inference as well:

```sh
COPILOT_CLI_PATH="$(command -v copilot)" \
COPILOT_SDK_PATH="$HOME/.copilot/pkg/darwin-arm64/1.0.83/copilot-sdk" \
PR_REVIEW_MODEL_1=claude-sonnet-5 PR_REVIEW_EFFORT_1=low \
PR_REVIEW_MODEL_2=gpt-5.6-terra PR_REVIEW_EFFORT_2=high \
node scripts/smoke-runtime.mjs --fixture
```

The opt-in probe requires two different reviewer session IDs, positive execution
overlap, matching actual subscription-model/reasoning usage, visible progress
and results, and unchanged parent model/reasoning. It does not assert the
model-generated findings are correct; validation/deduplication belong to Q4.
